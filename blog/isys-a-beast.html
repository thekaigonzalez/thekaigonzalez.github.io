<h1>ISys: A whole 'nother beast.</h1>

<p>

ISys is a strict, imperative, functional programming language written by Kai Gonzalez (me :)),
lets see the core language and break it down a bit.

</p>

<h2>The Start of ISys</h2>

<p>

ISys started as a tiny project to test how good Kai's lexer skills were, which then started adding more features to become
an entire Programming language.
<br>
The Programming language isn't used for anything too major, but recent changes allow including, and OS checks.

</p>

<h2>ISys Lexer</h2>

<p>

ISys contains the following features.
<br>
<li>Lexer</li>
<li>AST (very cheap, simple)</li>
<li>Parser (very simple)</li>
<li>Function handler (very simple, few functions)</li>
<li>And an Include system.</li>
<br>
An example code would be:

<pre>
**comment ;
(PRINT hello, world!);

</pre>

Lets break this code down.

<br>

<b>( & )</b>
<br>
This is called ISys's <b>Lisp</b> interface.
<br>
These are optional, but are recommended.
<b>THIS SECTION IS OBFUSCATE AFTER FIX!!! ISYS NO LONGER HAS "BLEED" AND CHECKS ALL TOKENS ACCORDINGLY</b>
ISys has something called a "BLEED", it's like a marker. Check this out:
<br>
There is a small chance for this code to print hello PRINT world, since there's no ';' separating it.

<pre>

PRINT hello PRINT world!;

</pre>
But if you do,

<pre>

PRINT hello; PRINT world!;

</pre>
That will just print helloworld (or possibly hello world)
<pre>

PRINT hello
PRINT

</pre>

</p>

<h2>Why don't strings use '"'</h2>

<p>

ISys has it's own string rules.

<pre>if [string] is not reserved then print, else then evaluate</pre>

It's a dynamic string, so something like

PRINT 'hello, world!'

Can just be 

PRINT hello, world!

</p>

<h2>Flexibility</h2>

<p>

ISys's syntax is very flexible in terms of Readability, check this out

</p>

<pre>

(PRINT
	hello);
(PRINT hello;PRINT world); ** statements in statements, what the f- ;

IF Linux DO (EXECUTE gcc -v && echo hello);

</pre>
