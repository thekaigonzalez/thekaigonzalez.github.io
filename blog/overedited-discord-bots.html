<h1>Over-edited Discord Bots & Why I think it's unneccessary</h1>

<p>

Discord Bots are a great user experience for the various users of the
Cross-platform multicommunication service discord, But lets get my opinion
on how some Discord Bots "over-do" it in some circumstances.

</p>

<h2>What makes a "Discord Bot"</h2>

<p>

Well first we need to define a bot. An "internet bot" is an autonomous program on
the internet (or any other network) that can interact with Systems or Users.
<br>
A couple of good examples of Bots would be Slack Bots, <b>Discord</b> Bots, and
GitHub Bots. We're specifically looking at the Discord Bots.

</p>

<h2>Understanding the Logic behind Discord Bots</h2>

<p>

Discord Bots are automatic, meaning they don't need a human manually operating
them, as long as you give it the right logic.
<br>
See, computers aren't the smartest machines out there; they need a sort of direction to go in.
<br>
If you're telling your computer to press "1", how would it register that?
Fun fact: It doesn't.
Your computer has a bunch of code making sure that once you press "1",
It will tell the computer a bunch of things to do with that "1". (Including, actually pressing the key)
<br>
In a way, that logic applies to Discord Bots. If you just say BOT, it won't do anything,
There's a certain way to create discord bots. And you can find the documentation @ https://discord.com/developers .

</p>

<h2>Closed Source Discord Bots</h2>

<p>

If I haven't said this enough, I do not like closed source software.
<br>
I like to be able to know what a program is doing on my hardware, and dissect the
program and possibly create my own version of that Program (For educational purposes.)
<br>
And lets take Dank Memer, Dank Memer is a very popular Discord Bot which isn't as 
open source as i'd like it to be. But it is for good reason.
<br>
Taken from a reddit post, Dank Memer was originally an Open source discord bot, until people started to find Currency exploits for it.
And I could understand that, but if you have no reason to close your Discord Bot, then
I recommend you don't. Unless there's a very serious reason to.

</p>

<h2>Open Source Discord Bots</h2>

<p>

(I'm going to refer to Open Source Discord Bots as OSDB, Please do not get confused.)

OSDB are one of my favorite kinds of Discord Bots, because I can see how people
do it, and learn different things about say Node.js, which is what most Discord Bots
are made with.
<br>
I enjoy Discord Bots, I really do, But some bots with that "proprietary blend", kind of
ruin it for me.

And some people would go on to say "I need paying for hosting services so I put premium",
Which is cool, cool cool cool cool <b>cool</b>, I get if you need to have to pay
for the hosting provider, since the Person who chose the provider needs to pay
for the provider, which is the case in most scenarios. I just don't like
the bots which force premium down your throat for literally most bot features.
<br>
let the user get familiar with the bot, have fun with most commands, and if
they feel they need more commands, and support the bot, make the extra features
premium only. This puts the user in a place where they need extra commands, and 
they're willing to pay a few dollars to support the Bot.

</p>

<h2>Personal Take: Commands Should not be limited!</h2>

<p>

If people have the time, and the money (which in most cases, it should be free),
They should invest in a plugin system.
<br>
No matter if you have to have it on a Webpage, or in the Discord App itself,
You should always, ALWAYS recommended by me try to find a way to implement plugins into your bot.
<br>
This allows users to create their own customized servers, and allows them
to be creative with your bot.

</p>

<h2>Personal Take: Why I don't like the "My Bot Does This this and this"</h2>

<p>

I definitely fall into this category. Not for Discord Bots specifically, but
with my open source distributed software.
<br>
Back in 2020, I'd make software and claim for it to have all of these features,
without even making the first version. I was assuming I could build a bunch
of features and put it out in a snap!
<br>
and in most cases, I'd end up abandoning the project due to unrealistic circumstances.
<br>
And I'm not saying that's the case for all Discord Bots that go,
My Bot does this super cool thing with a lot of other things. I'm just saying
that in some particular cases where the bot homepage, or help menu says "This bot does everything in the discord world",
It usually didn't do 1/2 of the things on the list.
<br>
I recommend you add features to the feature list AS you are making them, or better yet; AFTER you've made all the base features.
Therefore; you wont stress out after having a giant checklist of things you don't even know if you can do.
