<h1>Why I'm using D instead of C</h1>

<p>

C is something known as a "low-level" Systems programming language, meaning
it gives me access to the hardware to be able to perform direct system calls,
as well as be able to build libraries around these calls to better aid in Programming.
<br>
<br>

D can also be categorized as a systems programming language, as OS Kernels, and devices have been made with it.
The only difference is D has a wider variety of High-Level functions that I'm
able to use ON-TOP of the existing Low-Level functions to provide much more feature-full software.

<h2>History</h2>

<p>

C The C programming language came out of Bell Labs in the early 1970s.
According 
to the Bell Labs paper The Development of the C Language by Dennis Ritchie, 
â€œThe C programming language was devised in the early 1970s as a system 
implementation language for the nascent Unix operating system.

<br>
<br>

The D programming language began in 1999 as an 
effort to pull the best features of these 
languages into a new one. Fittingly, D would use 
the by that time mature C/C++ back end (optimizer and code generator) that 
had been under continued development and maintenance since 1982.

<h2>So why didn't I use C instead of D?</h2>

<p>

To put it simply, I needed better support for certain operations.

<br>
<br>

C is nice, but it does not have the algorithmic functionality that I need,
and D gives me that functionality.
<br>

Now I could've implemented my own algorithm, But i decided to go with D as
It already had most of the algorithms that I use today in languages like Lua,
C++, and others.

<br>

D also gives less segmentation faults, and even then they're easier to catch.
And I'm still exploring the Digital Mars & GNU compilers.
