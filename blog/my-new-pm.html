<h1>My new Package Manager!</h1>

<p>

I've made a new Package Manager called 
gitstrap which installs pretty much all of my Computer software
using simple python3 code and makefiles. Lets break down how it works,
and how I could've done it better.

</p>

<h2>The GitStrap Repository</h2>

<p>

GitStrap allows requests to be sent in and uses the thekaigonzalez.github.io as a base.
<br>
It takes the file and requests it like so.

https GET thekaigonzalez.github.io/cdn/REQ.tar.gz


</p>

<h2>Simplicity</h2>

<p>

GitStrap is a very simple package manager, built to really only install MY software.
You can change one line of code to add your own Repository, or you can use the default website (thekaigonzalez.github.io)

</p>

<h2>GitStrap: Flaws</h2>

<p>

GitStrap is written in Python 3.9 on Arch Linux.
GitStrap doesn't have a true backend, only one file to install all packages.
<br>
That's all that it does, nothing really important.
